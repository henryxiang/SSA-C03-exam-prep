# AWS SAA-C03 Exam Study Notes

## The AWS Well-Architected Frameworkd

The Six Pillars

- Operational excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performace efficiency
- Cost optimization
- Sustainability

### Operational excellence pillar

- Perform operations as code: version control, code review
- Annotated documentation: CloudFormation (CDK)
- Make frequent, small and reversible changes: atomic tasks
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

### Security pillar

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers (not only network)
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest (TLS, VPN, Object Store, FS Encryption)
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

### Reliability pillar

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Automatically manage changes

### Performance efficiency pillar

- Democratize advanced technologies (AWS managed services)
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Mechanical sympathy (utilize correct technology to meet the requirements)

### Cost optimization pillar

- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency (monitoring, instrumentation, logging)
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

### Sustainability pillar

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
